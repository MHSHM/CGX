# CGX
This is my play ground when it comes to learning and implementing Computer Graphics stuff.

# Implenemted so far
- Deferred rendering.
- SSAO (Screen space ambient occlusion).
- Real-time shader editor.
- Thread pool.
- Physically Based Shading model.
- Omnidirectional shadow maps.
- Normal mapping.
- Image Based Lighting.

# Screenshots
Omnidirectional shadow maps.

# The next Steps
- Writing a path tracer using OpenGL Compute Shaders.
- Automate the transition between the different scenes.
